About the content

The origninal tileset included in this top down dungeon environment creation pack included a top down perspective tile set with one back wall face visible and the remaining three walls displaying the wall tops only. The perspective tileset included in this extra content folder will allow you to create tile maps in a top down perspective displaying all wall faces as seen in some classic top down RGP style games. This extra content tileset may also work with some of the tiles from the main tile set although you may have to run your own tests on that. 

To make props form the dungeon environment pack work with this tileset you will need to rotate them accordingly. 

Hope you enjoy this addendum. If there are any questions please feel free to contatc me on the game developer studio Discord server.
